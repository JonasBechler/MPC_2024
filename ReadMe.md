# Model Predictive Control

In the couse Model Predictive Control (MPC) we gained insights on how MPC works and how it can be implemented.

This repository contains the implementation of this lecture. As well with the task given by the lecturer. The goal is to control an arbitraty system with the help of MPC, given the systems parametes, the dead time of the system as well as a initial horizon, a control horizon and a prediction horizon.

There are also some properties of MPC for validating the control parameters which are checked after calculation.

The program checks all properies and sets the controll inputs accordingly. Then it plots the results of all properties.

## Disclaimers

This is under construction and will be updated soon.
